# Houdini Tools and Scripts

## Houdini Version Control Tool

The Houdini Version Control Tool allows a user to increment and save a Houdini file with a version suffix automatically. This can be done via the "File" main menu in the upper toolbar or through the shelf tool.

Features include:
* Auto-increment and save versions with _v### suffix
* Add default v001 if file does not have version 
* Provides user option to overwrite or save as latest version if incremented version already exists
* Easily view a list of all versions of the current file via the shelf tool
* Seamlessly switch between versions by double-clicking to open desired version from the list

### Installation

1. Download the repo files and save anywhere. (Remember the path of where you saved)
2. Find your user houdini files 
    - For Windows, it is usually in C:\Users\[yourUser]\Documents\houdini19.5
3. Create an empty folder called "packages" (all lowercase) if it does not already exist
4. Inside this new folder, create a new "packages.json" file
    - The json file should include the path where you saved the tool files, like this:
    ```
    {
    "package_path": ["Insert path to tool files here"]
    }
    ```
    - You may use Houdini's included file paths depending on where you saved it. Ex: $HOME/Projects/HoudiniTools_KJ
